# Portfolio_Wine_Quality_Analysis_Using_Python
Set of real world dataset tasks is completed by using the Python Pandas, Seborn, and Matplotlib library.


## Background Information:
In this porfolio we use Python Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about a quality of different kinds of wine. 
This data set contains various chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol. It also contains a quality metric (3-9, with highest being better) 


## Description of Qualities:
1. Alcohol: the amount of alcohol in wine
2. Volatile acidity: acetic acid content which leading to an unpleasant vinegar taste
3. Sulphates: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
4. Citric Acid: acts as a preservative to increase acidity (small quantities add freshness and flavor to wines)
5. Total Sulfur Dioxide: is the amount of SO2
6. Density: sweeter wines have a higher density
7. Chlorides: the amount of salt
8. Fixed acidity: are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate easily
9. pH: the level of acidity
10. Free Sulfur Dioxide: it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
11. Residual sugar: is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. (Wines > 45g/ltrs are sweet)

In this section we explore 5 high level business analysis related to our data:

1. Count the number of different quality of wines.
2. Relationship between volatile acidity and quality of wines.
3. Relationship between sulphates and quality of wines.
4. Relationship between citric acid and quality of wines.
5. Finding the correlation.

To answer these questions we walk through many different numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib methods. They include:

2. Plotting bar charts, box plots, and correlation plots to visualize our results
3. Labeling our graphs
